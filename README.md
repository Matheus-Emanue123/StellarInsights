 ## 📄 Research Paper
 This project is based on the research article:  
 [Investigating Stellar Composition and Mass as Indicators of Earth-like Exoplanets: Findings from Graph Examination](https://github.com/Matheus-Emanue123/StellarInsights/blob/main/artigo/Investigating_Stellar_Composition_and_Mass_as_Indicators_of_Earth_like_Exoplanets__Findings_from_Graph_Examination.pdf)
 
 ## 📌 Overview
 This repository contains code for analyzing stellar metallicity and mass in relation to Earth-like exoplanets using graph-based methods. It includes:
 - Interactive graph construction
 - Cluster analysis and statistical tests
 - Planetary mass and metallicity analysis
 
 ## ⚙️ Installation and Setup
 ### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
 Ensure you have the following installed:
 - Python (>=3.8)
 - GCC/G++ (>=11) for compiling C/C++ dependencies
 
 ### 2️⃣ Clone the repository
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Matheus-Emanue123/StellarInsights.git
 cd StellarInsights
 ```
 
 ### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
 Create a virtual environment and install required Python packages:
 ```bash
 python -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 
 ## 🚀 Running the Project
